      <div class="post">
        <p>Hello!</p>

        <p>Let's talk about the trolley problem.</p>

        <p>The trolley problem is a moral dilemma aimed at figuring out whether someone is more utilitarian or emotional.</p>

        <p>It goes like this.</p>

        <p><img src="/assets/img/issues/7/trolley.jpg" class="trolley" /></p>

        <p>There's a runaway trolley barreling down a railway. Further down the tracks there are five people tied up and unable to move. They will die once the trolley reaches them.</p>

        <p>You are stood on a footbridge with an innocent bystander. You can push him off the bridge, blocking the trolley and killing him, but saving the other 5 people. Or you can do nothing and the 5 people will die.</p>

        <p>There are no legal implications. It's not a trick question. What do you do?</p>

        <p>What do most say?</p>

        <p>If you said no to pushing the man, join the crowd.</p>

        <p>Most studies agree. The majority of people choose not to intervene and kill the man. The utilitarian option isn't the popular one.</p>

        <p>In one <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0094842">study</a> we see just 18% of people choosing to kill the man. Broken down by country, 0% of Koreans chose to kill the man.</p>

        <p>This makes sense.</p>

        <p>In most parts of the world, to kill is one of the worst crimes. Not only laws, but also religions, societies and other moral and belief systems agree.</p>

        <p>Words such as "kill" and "die" carry a lot of power and negative meaning across the language spectrum.</p>

        <h2>The language effect</h2>

        <p>But what about when asked in a foreign language? Does another language affect how people behave in this dilemma?</p>

        <p>Surprisingly, the answer is yes.</p>

        <p>When the trolley problem is presented to people in a second language – one they speak well – people answer less emotionally.</p>

        <p>The 18% of people choosing to kill the man jumps to a surprising 44%. English to Spanish jumps from 28% to 44%. English to French jumps from 20% to 33%. Even 7.5% of the Koreans now say that would intervene and kill the man.</p>

        <p>The study concludes:</p>

        <p>
          <blockquote>
            "People’s moral judgments and decisions depend on the native-ness of the language in which a dilemma is presented, becoming more utilitarian in a foreign language".
          </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>This brings up some interesting questions:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Are members of a Jury in a second language less swayed by emotional arguments?</li>
          <li>When resolving conflicts, does a second language reduce the impact of emotions and facilitate more logical decision-making?</li>
          <li>Are creativity and problem solving improved in another language?</li>
        </ol>

        <p>I don't know about you, but I'm not short of reasons to learn new languages. And yet out of the blue, now I have another.</p>

        <p>Learn a new language and expand your ability to think differently.</p>
