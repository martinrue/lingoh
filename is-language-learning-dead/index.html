        <p>Welcome to the first edition of Ling-oh! The newsletter for people who find language profoundly awesome.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for subscribing and supporting!</p>

        <p>Alright, let's get into it.</p>

        <h2>Should we learn languages in 2024?</h2>

        <p>3 months ago I moved to Vietnam. Vietnamese is <b>very different</b> to the other languages I speak. This is true for most Westerners here.</p>

        <p>How people solve this problem is surprising. A phone is passed back and forth repeatedly. They write in Vietnamese and you wait. You write back in English and they wait, and so on.</p>

        <p>There's a strong sense of exclusion when this happens. I'm here on the other side of the world, yet the closest I can get is still the other side of a phone.</p>

        <p>A month was more than enough to realise: I was living in the country, but I was still very much on the outside.</p>

        <h2>What about [insert app]?</h2>

        <p>Every year a new app or AI instant translator claims to have made this better, but in the end, they're all missing the point. You're still an outsider.</p>

        <p>
          Learning a language is an opportunity to open a door to a place's culture, to its people. It's being granted access to the inside. Through language we get to see, feel and understand much deeper than we can by passing a phone back and forth. We also become seen and treated differently by
          others.
        </p>

        <p>Sure, sometimes you just need to solve a problem quickly. But let's not confuse that for speaking a language and the richness that comes with it.</p>

        <h2>What a difference 24 hours makes</h2>

        <p>For the past 2 months I've been taking Vietnamese classes, and let me tell you, my experience in Vietnam has massively improved.</p>

        <p><i>"2 months? I don't have that kind of time!"</i> I hear you exclaim.</p>

        <p>Don't be fooled. I have a weekly 1-hour class and 2 extra hours of self study. Here's the math: 24 hours. <b>1 day.</b></p>

        <p>That's not a lot of time. I didn't start with the goal of attaining fluency, nor do I have that goal now. The thing is, a little bit of effort goes a long way. As the Pareto principle says: 20% of the effort gets you 80% of the results.</p>

        <p>In my case it was only 3%!</p>

        <p>From a relatively tiny effort, my experience here in Vietnam has become immeasurably better.</p>

        <h2>Long live language learning</h2>

        <p>I now address my taxi driver using local language, showing that I acknowledge him as my elder – an important feature of Vietnamese and other Asian languages. His eyes light up as he turns around to congratulate me on my "tiếng Việt".</p>

        <p>I order my "cơm chiên gà" (chicken fried rice) expertly avoiding "cơm chiên ga" (fried rice gas). My little attempts to use the language everywhere I can creates a totally different energy from pretty much everyone I interact with. I feel like I'm on the inside.</p>

        <p>Language learning is alive and well.</p>

        <p>Go learn a new language. Become more connected to a place and its people. Put yourself on the inside and discover the richness of having an altered way of thinking. Be accepted as more than just a tourist looking in.</p>
