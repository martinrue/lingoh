        <p>Hello!</p>

        <p>What Henry Ford meant by this is that our beliefs play a much bigger role in the outcome than we might think.</p>

        <p>And what better example than learning a new language.</p>

        <h2>The courage to try</h2>

        <p>If we believe we can, we're more likely to try. Trying sooner means making mistakes earlier. Making mistakes earlier means we fix them earlier. That's learning in a nutshell.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, when we believe we're not ready, we're more likely to chase perfection instead.</p>

        <p>We get caught up in perfectionism paralysis. We strive for a state that we can't actually reach without doing the thing, and yet doing the thing is exactly what we're avoiding.</p>

        <h2>Embrace the chaos</h2>

        <p>Instead of chasing perfection, consider embracing the chaos.</p>

        <p>Sure, maybe you can only introduce yourself as Señor Potato at the start, but why should that stop you?</p>

        <p>As the well-known polyglot and author Benny Lewis says in Fluent in 3 Months:</p>

        <p>
          <blockquote>
            "Learn a few basic words and speak from day one. Use the language even if it’s via the internet. With that, you will get practice, even if you speak like Tarzan."
          </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>Similarly, watching your favourite TV show in a new language, even if you understand nothing, helps you get used to the sounds and rhythm of the language.</p>

        <p>Trying to read the news exposes you to everyday words and their cousins, even if you don't totally understand them yet.</p>

        <p>Trying to order your coffee in Spanish, or asking if the approaching train stops at your stop in German helps you see that nothing bad happens when you try.</p>

        <p><b>Compare this:</b></p>

        <p>I speak like a toddler. I'm ashamed of that. I won’t try to say anything until I can speak like an adult. I'm so embarrassed when people hear me try, especially if I make a mistake.</p>

        <p><b>With this:</b></p>

        <p>
          I speak like a toddler and I love it! I say anything and everything I can, even if it's mixed with English words for now. Every time I try, I get better and more confident. People aren't judging me. In fact, they think it's cool and courageous that I'm trying to learn their language so
          openly.
        </p>

        <p>So, are you ready to start speaking the new language you’re learning?</p>

        <p>Yes, you are ready.</p>
